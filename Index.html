          In yonder realm where love doth unfold, A visual epic, a tale to be
          told. Not merely an event, but a saga profound, Of stolen glances and
          whispers, love unbound. <br />
          In Queenstown's heart, New Zealand's embrace, A canvas we craft, each
          frame a grace. A chapter, a verse, in memories divine, Where love's
          symphony, forever shall shine.
        </h3>

          An ode to our union, unique and prime, Trust the lens, as it captures
          the time. Preserving layers of love, a tapestry grand, Moments
          enduring, as grains of love's sand.
          <br />
          Join the symphony, our wedding day's art, Details etched, pixels that
          never depart. A shared artistry, a dance of the heart, In the pixels,
          our love shall never depart.
